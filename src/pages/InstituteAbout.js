                    <p>As the largest university in North Texas and second largest in The University of
                        Texas System, UTA is located in the heart of Dallas-Fort Worth, challenging our students to
                        engage with the world around them in ways that make a measurable impact.

                        UTA offers state-of-the-art facilities that encourage students to be critical thinkers. Through
                        academic, internship, and research programs, our students receive real-world experiences that
                        help them contribute to their community and, ultimately, the world.

                        We have more than 180 baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degree programs, and more than
                        41,000 students walking our campus or engaging in online coursework each year.
